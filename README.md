Features:-
- Extract, transform, and load (ETL) financial data from various sources.
- Create interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize key financial metrics and trends.

For Tableau :-

I will need to connect to my SQL database and create dashboards. Here is how:

- Load the table I created in the ETL process.
- Create interactive dashboards by dragging and dropping fields to visualize key financial metrics and trends.
